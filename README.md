# wasp

wasp is a package for wavelet analysis of disease case series from multiple locations, aimed to detect and describe spatial patterns of the disease.

Inspired by a famous paper by Grenfell et al. [1], I aimed to create a shareable code to perform similar wavelet analysis methods to describe periodic behaviour of disease case series from multiple locations.

# wasp

`wasp` is an R package for wavelet analysis of disease case series from multiple locations, aimed to detect and describe spatial patterns of the disease. I aimed to create a shareable code to perform wavelet analysis methods to describe periodic behaviour of disease case series from multiple locations.

## Installation

To install the github version of `wasp`:

```r
devtools::install_github("mc30/wasp")
```
